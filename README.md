# fetch-me-some-fake-planets
Exercise retrieving and sorting planet data from the SWAPI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

When starting new, first run `npm install`. 
To run the dev environment & compiler, run `npm start`
To build for production, run `npm run build`

## Folder Structure

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.
